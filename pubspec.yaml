  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/logo.png
    - assets/images/child.jpg
    - assets/images/child1.jpg
    - assets/images/child2.jpg
    - assets/images/child3.jpg
    - assets/images/child4.jpeg
    - assets/images/man.jpg
    - assets/images/man1.jpg
    - assets/images/man2.jpg
    - assets/images/man3.jpeg
    - assets/images/man5.jpg
    - assets/images/model.jpg
    - assets/images/model1.jpg
    - assets/images/model2.jpg
    - assets/images/model3.jpg
    - assets/images/model4.jpg
    - assets/images/model5.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.


  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Billabong
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Billabong.ttf
          style: italic
    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito.ttf
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
